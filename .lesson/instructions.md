# N5 CS 2019 Task 2B

Logan is a technician who has to generate usernames for a school’s Wi-Fi service.

Logan wants to write a program that will automatically generate unique usernames for students. The usernames have to be six characters long. The program should generate and display a list of student usernames.

## Program analysis

The program will ask how many usernames are to be generated. For each username, the first three letters of the student’s first name will be entered and then combined with a random ending from the list below.

The program stores five endings:

ing  
end  
axe  
gex  
goh


For a student with the first name David the technician would enter Dav. The program will generate the username by joining Dav to one of the endings listed above. For example the username generated could be Daving.

___2a___ Complete the table by filling in the missing input, process and output. __(3 marks)__

|  | Input |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | 
| 2 | Enter the first 3 letters of the student name |

|  | Process |
| :---: | --- |
| 1 | Check length of partial student name |
| 2 | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |
| 3 | Add the partial student name with the randomly generated ending from the stored list |

|  | Output |
| :---| --- |
| 1 | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |

### Main Steps: Pseudocode

```
1. Store the endings

2. Enter the number of students

3. Start fixed loop for each student

    4. Enter first three letters of student’s name

    5. Generate random number

    6. Generate username

    7. Display the username

8. End Loop
```

### REFINEMENTS

```
4.1.    Start conditional loop

4.2.        Get the first three letters of student’s name

4.3.        If the length of the name is not equal to 3 then

4.4.            Display an error message

4.5.        End If

4.6.    Repeat until the name entered is 3 characters long


6.1.    If the first random number was generated add the first stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

6.2.    If the second random number was generated add the second stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

6.3.    If the third random number was generated add the third stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

6.4.    If the fourth random number was generated add the fourth stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

6.5.    If the fifth random number was generated add the fifth stored ending to the end of the first three letters of the student’s name

```
